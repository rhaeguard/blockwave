## Todo

- [ ] Ability to play a very simple game from start to finish. Nothing fancy, just a limited number of enemies coming at you and you defending. 
- [ ] Defenders shooting at the enemy
- [ ] Have different type of game objects (different defenders, different enemies, boxes with various capabilities)
- [ ] Ability to pick the things we want to insert in the world
- [ ] Limited inventory
- [ ] Customize the sprites (using existing block sprites for now)
- [ ] Enemy waves
- [ ] Publish on itch.io?
- [ ] Terrain as a defense: use sand/mud/water to slow down the wave
